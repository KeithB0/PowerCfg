# PowerCfg for PowerShell
## Why?
Because this:
```cmd
powercfg /setacvalueindex 44cd9e71-a820-4b41-b140-c31bfd6d8d16 533946e9-7bb0-45a1-a491-c2869dc960f7 90bc6708-88e1-4e70-8ec9-dc020b9c6dbc 0
```
sucks.

PowerCfg module offers working with names instead of Guids, because...of course.

Isn't this better?
```powershell
Set-PowercfgSetting -PowerScheme Balanced -SubGroup Display -Setting "turn off" -SetAC -Value 0
```
and, **Aliased**:
```powershell
spcs balanced display "turn off" 0 -setac
```

I hope to soon add methods to the custom object types and more functions to cover the variety of switches present in the windows command.
